# Next Step: Iteration 1 - Solution Structure & Project Setup

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Main Solution Structure

#### 1.1 Create Solution Directory and File
- [ ] Create directory structure: `./src/xrai.projectradar.application/`
- [ ] Initialize main solution file: `xrai.projectradar.application.sln`

### 2. Create Backend ASP.NET Core Project

#### 2.1 Initialize Backend Project
- [ ] Create directory: `./src/xrai.projectradar.application/xrai.projectradar.backend/`
- [ ] Initialize empty ASP.NET Core Web API project using `dotnet new webapi`
- [ ] Configure project to target .NET 8
- [ ] Add project reference to main solution file

#### 2.2 Configure Basic Backend Structure
- [ ] Remove default WeatherForecast controller and related files
- [ ] Configure minimal API endpoints structure (create a simple health endpoint)
- [ ] Add basic appsettings.json configuration
- [ ] Verify backend project builds independently with `dotnet build`

### 3. Create Test Project with NUnit and NSubstitute

#### 3.1 Initialize Test Project
- [ ] Create directory: `./src/xrai.projectradar.application/tests/xrai.projectradar.backend.tests/`
- [ ] Initialize NUnit test project using `dotnet new nunit`
- [ ] Add NuGet package references: NSubstitute for mocking
- [ ] Add project reference to backend project being tested

#### 3.2 Configure Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Remove default UnitTest1.cs file
- [ ] Create basic test class structure following naming conventions
- [ ] Add simple dummy unit test to verify test infrastructure works
- [ ] Configure test project settings and test runner integration

#### 3.3 Verify Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Run tests using `dotnet test` command
- [ ] Verify test discovery and execution works correctly
- [ ] Ensure tests can be run from IDE test explorer
- [ ] Validate test output and reporting format

### 4. Create Aspire AppHost Project

#### 4.1 Initialize Aspire Project
- [ ] Create directory: `./src/xrai.projectradar.application/xrai.projectradar.AppHost/`
- [ ] Initialize .NET Aspire AppHost project
- [ ] Add required Aspire NuGet packages and dependencies
- [ ] Configure basic Aspire application host setup

#### 4.2 Configure Service References
- [ ] Add reference to backend project in Aspire AppHost
- [ ] Configure basic service discovery and orchestration
- [ ] Set up initial Aspire dashboard and monitoring
- [ ] Verify Aspire project structure and configuration

### 5. Organize Solution with Folders

#### 5.1 Create Solution Folders
- [ ] Add "tests" solution folder in main solution file
- [ ] Add "dev" solution folder in main solution file
- [ ] Move test project into "tests" solution folder
- [ ] Move Aspire AppHost project into "dev" solution folder

#### 5.2 Verify Solution Organization
- [ ] Confirm proper folder structure in IDE solution explorer
- [ ] Ensure all projects are properly categorized
- [ ] Verify solution builds with organized structure
- [ ] Test that all project references work correctly

### 6. Final Integration and Verification

#### 6.1 Complete Solution Build Test
- [ ] Clean solution using `dotnet clean`
- [ ] Restore all packages using `dotnet restore`
- [ ] Build entire solution using `dotnet build`
- [ ] Run all tests using `dotnet test`

#### 6.2 IDE Integration Verification
- [ ] Open solution in Visual Studio or VS Code
- [ ] Verify IntelliSense and project navigation works
- [ ] Test debugging capabilities on backend project
- [ ] Confirm test runner integration in IDE

## Expected Outcomes

- Complete .NET 8 solution structure with proper organization
- Functional ASP.NET Core Web API backend project
- Working test infrastructure with NUnit and NSubstitute
- .NET Aspire AppHost project configured for local development
- All projects properly referenced and organized in solution folders
- Verified build and test pipeline working end-to-end

## Next Iteration Preview

The next iteration (Iteration 2) will focus on Infrastructure & Docker Setup, including:
- Creating docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ services
- Implementing Docker Secrets configuration for sensitive values
- Setting up containerized development environment
- Creating helper scripts for local development setup

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK installed
- Git repository initialized
- Development environment (Visual Studio, VS Code, or compatible IDE)
- Basic understanding of .NET project structure

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Solution builds successfully with `dotnet build`
- [ ] All unit tests pass with `dotnet test`
- [ ] Solution opens and loads correctly in IDE
- [ ] Project references work properly between all components
- [ ] Solution folder organization matches specification requirements
- [ ] Aspire AppHost can be initialized (even if not fully configured yet)
- [ ] Code follows .NET naming conventions and project structure standards
