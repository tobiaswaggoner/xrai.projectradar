## Expected Outcomes

- Complete OpenTelemetry instrumentation with OTEL 1.7 across backend services
- Grafana stack running with Prometheus + Tempo + Grafana OSS dashboards
- OTLP exporter streaming traces and metrics to both Aspire and Grafana
- Serilog configured with OTLP as primary sink
- Comprehensive monitoring dashboards accessible at http://localhost:3000
- Enhanced development experience with integrated observability tooling

## Next Iteration Preview

The next iteration (Iteration 5) will focus on CI/CD Pipeline & Quality Gates:
- Implementing comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
- Adding automated build, test execution, and quality gate enforcement
- Integrating Trivy security scanning for container images and dependencies
- Setting up Dependabot for automated dependency updates
- Configuring branch protection rules and automated PR workflows
- This is distinct from the current observability focus and will build upon the monitoring foundation established here
