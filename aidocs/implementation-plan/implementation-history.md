## 2025-07-27 1.0 Solution Structure & Project Setup

### Summary

Created complete .NET 8 solution structure with proper organization:
- Main solution file: `xrai.projectradar.application.sln`
- ASP.NET Core Web API backend project with basic health endpoint
- NUnit test project with NSubstitute mocking framework and dummy test
- .NET Aspire AppHost project for local development orchestration
- Solution folders: "tests" and "dev" for proper organization
- All projects target .NET 8, build successfully, and tests pass

### Design decisions

All implementation follows the specifications exactly as outlined in the roadmap Phase 0. The solution structure matches the requirements with proper project references and folder organization.

## 2025-07-27 2.0 Infrastructure & Docker Setup

### Summary

Implemented complete containerized development environment with Docker Compose:
- Created `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL 17 and RabbitMQ 4.1.2 services
- Implemented Docker Secrets management for PostgreSQL authentication
- Created RabbitMQ configuration file approach for credentials (avoiding Docker Secrets complexity)
- Built comprehensive helper scripts in `./scripts/` directory:
  - `create-secret.sh`: Automated secret generation and RabbitMQ config creation
  - `dev-setup.sh`: Complete environment initialization
  - `dev-cleanup.sh`: Environment reset and cleanup
- Configured proper Docker networking, health checks, and service dependencies
- Set up development overrides with `docker-compose.override.yml`
- Added `.gitignore` rules for secrets and development files
- Created external documentation for RabbitMQ configuration approach

### Design decisions

- **RabbitMQ Secrets Approach**: Used configuration file mounting instead of Docker Secrets for RabbitMQ due to complexity of the latter approach. This provides adequate security for development while maintaining simplicity.
- **External vs Local Secrets**: Used external Docker secrets for PostgreSQL to demonstrate the pattern, with local file mounting as fallback for development.
- **Script Architecture**: Created modular scripts with proper error handling, logging, and user interaction for robust development workflow.
