We want to continue to implement the next iteration in our plan.
First we need to find what is to be done next and create a detailed plan for this iteration.

1. Read the following specs:
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-HighLevelArchitecture.md
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-HighLevelRoadmap.md
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-ProjectDescription.md
- Read @aidocs/implementation-plan/implementation-history.md
- Read @aidocs/implementation-plan/next-implementation-phase.md

2. Find the next thing to implement
From @aidocs/implementation-plan/next-implementation-phase.md, identify the next Iteration to implement taking into account @aidocs/implementation-plan/implementation-history.md.

3. Create an implementation plan for the next iteration
Delete the file @aidocs/implementation-plan/next-step.md if it exists.
Create a file @aidocs/implementation-plan/next-step.md
Create a detailed step by step implementation plan for the next iteration. Always include steps for creating and running unit tests. The plan should have the following format. Every step should include a Checkbox [ ] that can be "ticked off".
