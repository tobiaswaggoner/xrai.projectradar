1. Read the following specs:
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-HighLevelArchitecture.md
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-HighLevelRoadmap.md
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-ProjectDescription.md
- Read @aidocs/implementation-plan/implementation-history.md

2. Plan the next implementation phase
- if @aidocs/implementation-plan/next-implementation-phase.md exists, delete it.
- Based on @aidocs/ProjectRadar-HighLevelRoadmap.md and @aidocs/implementation-plan/implementation-history.md create a new markdown file: @aidocs/implementation-plan/next-implementation-phase.md
- Create a step by step plan on how to implement this phase.
- The steps should still be "high level" - they will be further refined later.
- The format should be:

# Implementation plan Phase {short description}

## Iteration 1

{Create a description of what should be done next. The scope should be large enough to be able to be split into 10-20 descrete tasks. Include all relevant details from your entire knowledge, but write as concise and condensed as possible.}

## Iteration 2
