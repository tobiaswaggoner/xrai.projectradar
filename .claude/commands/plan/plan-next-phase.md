1. Read the following specs:
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-HighLevelArchitecture.md
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-HighLevelRoadmap.md
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-ProjectDescription.md
- Read @aidocs/implementation-plan/implementation-history.md

2. Plan the next implementation phase
- if @aidocs/implementation-plan/next-implementation-phase.md exists, delete it.
- Based on @aidocs/ProjectRadar-HighLevelRoadmap.md and @aidocs/implementation-plan/implementation-history.md create a new markdown file: @aidocs/implementation-plan/next-implementation-phase.md
- Group all activities into coherent iterations. So not add too many items into each iteration.
- For each iteration, create a step by step plan on how to implement this phase.
- The steps should still be "high level" - they will be further refined later.

- The format should be as follows:

```markdown
# Implementation plan Phase {short description}

## Iteration 1

{Create a short, concise description of what the goal of this iteration is.}

- [] Step 1
- [] Step 2

---

## Iteration 2

{Create a short, concise description of what the goal of this iteration is.}

- [] Step 1
- [] Step 2

---

## Iteration 3
