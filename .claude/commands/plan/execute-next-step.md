We want to continue to implement our plan using our detailed plan for the next step.

1. Read the following specs to get the general project context
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-HighLevelArchitecture.md
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-HighLevelRoadmap.md
- Read @aidocs/ProjectRadar-ProjectDescription.md
- Read @aidocs/implementation-plan/implementation-history.md

2. Read the next iteration to implement
- Read @aidocs/implementation-plan/next-step.md
- Stop if the file is missing.

3. Implement the iteration.
- Make sure you are on the main branch
- Fetch all changes
- Create a new branch for the iteration called feature/{descriptive branch name}
- Implement the full iteration according to @aidocs/implementation-plan/next-step.md
- Do not add anything else

4. Wait for user review
- Do NOT update the "@aidocs/implementation-plan/implementation-history.md" or "@aidocs/implementation-plan/next-step.md" yet. 
- Wait for a user review.
