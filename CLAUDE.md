# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Project Radar** is a specialized platform for capturing, evaluating, and tracking project opportunities for freelancers and contractors. The system automates project collection and analysis using an AI-powered pipeline, presenting opportunities in an interactive Kanban-style interface.

## Architecture

This is a **reactive, message-driven microservice architecture** built on:

- **Event Sourcing (ES)** and **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**
- **Custom Event Store** following "Aggregateless Event Sourcing" with "Command Context Consistency"
- **Asynchronous communication** via RabbitMQ message bus
- **PostgreSQL** for both event store and read models

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: .NET 8 microservices
- **Frontend**: Blazor WebAssembly (prototyping with Next.js initially)
- **Message Bus**: RabbitMQ
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker with Docker Compose orchestration
- **Development**: dotnet Aspire for local development
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0/OIDC via Auth0
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Serilog, Grafana stack (Prometheus + Tempo)

## System Components

### Main Logical Parts
1. **Ingestion Pipeline**: Backend services processing raw opportunity data into structured information
2. **Interactive Component**: Blazor WebAssembly frontend + backend services for user interactions

### Core Services (Planned)
- **API Gateway**: HTTP endpoints for Blazor client, publishes commands to message bus
- **DataExtractionService**: LLM-based extraction of structured data from raw text
- **WeightingService**: AI scoring against user profile
- **DeduplicationService**: Hash-based duplicate detection
- **Projector Services**: Build read models from events for fast queries

## Development Setup

The project now has a working .NET 8 solution structure with established build/test commands:

- **Build**: `dotnet build` (from solution root: `src/xrai.projectradar.application/`)
- **Test**: `dotnet test` (runs all NUnit tests with NSubstitute mocking)
- **dotnet Aspire**: Run `dotnet aspire run` to start all services with live-reload
- **Docker Compose**: Single-command setup for development environment (planned)
- **Secrets Management**: Docker Secrets (no plain-text env files)

## User Workflow

The UI consists of three main areas:
1. **Inbox**: Entry point for new opportunities (move to backlog or archive)
2. **Backlog**: Collection of interesting opportunities (sorted by AI score, manual prioritization)
3. **Active (Kanban Board)**: Active acquisition pipeline with drag-and-drop workflow

## Data Flow Patterns

### Write Path (Commands)
1. UI action â†’ HTTP command to API Gateway
2. Command published to RabbitMQ
3. Service consumes command, validates state via Event Store
4. New domain event appended and published

### Read Path (Queries)
1. Projector consumes domain events
2. Updates denormalized read model tables
3. UI queries read models directly for fast display

## Quality Assurance

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline
- **Testing**: Unit tests with >80% code coverage target
- **Static Analysis**: Cyclomatic complexity and linting
- **Quality Gates**: All checks must pass for main branch merge
- **Code Metrics**: cloc pre-commit hook for tracking project progress

## Security Notes

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0/OIDC via Auth0
- **CSRF Protection**: Bearer token auth only, secure cookies
- **Secrets**: Managed via Docker Secrets
- **Token Validation**: JWT validation on all API requests

## Event Sourcing Specifics

- **Custom Event Store Library**: .NET library for PostgreSQL interaction
- **Key Methods**: `AppendToStream()`, `ReadStream()`
- **Consistency**: Optimistic concurrency via expected version
- **Retention**: Events stored indefinitely (GDPR compliance pending)

## Messaging (RabbitMQ)

- **Commands Exchange**: Topic exchange for command routing
- **Events Exchange**: Topic exchange for domain events
- **Multiple Consumers**: Projectors can subscribe to same events

## Current Status

The project has completed **Phase 0 (Foundation & Scaffolding)**. A complete .NET 8 solution structure is now implemented with:

- Main solution: `src/xrai.projectradar.application/xrai.projectradar.application.sln`
- ASP.NET Core Web API backend project with basic health endpoint
- NUnit test project with NSubstitute framework and passing tests
- .NET Aspire AppHost project for development orchestration
- Proper solution folder organization ("tests", "dev")

**Next Phase**: Infrastructure & Docker Setup, then UI/UX Prototyping. Future development will follow the reactive microservices architecture outlined above.
