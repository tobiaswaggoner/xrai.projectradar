Transcript:
(00:02) Finally. Finally. I'm super excited. Uh today uh not not today. right now at uh 11:30 Central European Summer Time, I will starting on my next uh let's say uh larger project and uh I'm excited because I didn't start a uh a large private project or a larger private project for quite some time now due to a lot of uh professional requirements in my daily work.
(00:32) But today I'm starting the project radar project here. And this one is super special because I have something special in mind. Um I want to basically do some kind of a live coding on a big project with 100 plus hours of development time uh planned at this point. And um I not only want to record every single minute I am working on this project uh in form of a video recording.
(01:01) Um actually I will not post every maybe I post everything as a long form but uh I will do condense things then but uh I also plan to deeply analyze every single step and every single activity I spent during these videos and then I can condense lessons learned and and things from it.
(01:27) Um the reason I do this is because I want to fully generate the complete code of this project. Uh so this will be purely AI coded so that I finally have an argument for all the guys out there who say you can only use AI coding in the July of 2025 uh for prototypy stuff and uh it really cannot do software development. I will prove you wrong because I have the experience that with enough thought you actually can pull this off.
(01:58) Maybe it's not will will not be uh working. So uh I actually I never did a fully generated project this size so far. So we will see how far we get. I think architecture is one of the important parts. But let's see. So um I have let's see can I click here? So uh what is this about? So I want to create a opportunity spotting and evaluating and tracking platform software thing.
(02:26) So this means I I am working as a like freelance developer consultant uh for a couple of decades now. And um what I want to do is I want to have kind of a uh ingestion pipeline. uh every time I spot a potential project opportunity uh I want to just um copy paste the the input drop it somewhere and uh I want to have uh AI magic uh extract data evaluate this uh against my my own uh preferences and skills and everything and then create a nice canban style um project management platform on top of this.
(03:02) I will come to details later. And um if I have the pipeline in place, I can also create automated crawlers obviously so that I actually can and this is why it's called a radar that I can actually um let uh the system um have its eye opens for potentially super interesting opportunities. And uh the the the main idea is to have these AI evaluators who can actually judge the project against my own preferences and my own availability and my skills.
(03:40) And by doing so just um immediately can judge if this was would be something I would be highly interested in. And um so this is my opportunity spotting and tracking system I want to want to build. This is project radar. Um I have some quirks planned. So uh this will be a rather complex um uh production create project from scratch.
(04:07) So um I plan to deliberately overengineer this to a certain degree because I want to both build some infrastructure. I want to both build some um interesting backend um technology. So um we will using we will be using event sourcing in the in the main application for example and I want to build my own event store uh with some quirks um that are not available in the actual implementations I found so far.
(04:39) So we will have infrastructure components we will have like backend technology. So I own develop back end um um development um plus the UI plus the crawlers. This is a microser distributed microser um application will be fully messagebased so reactive. Uh so interesting uh architecture absolutely overengineered for a private project for myself.
(05:04) I could do this I could pull this off basically in 20 20 hours if I would go with a a single user thing but um doing all this stuff right including recording and everything I plan for 100 hours and uh since I cannot do this fulltime this is planned to go within 4 weeks. So then I want to take these recordings and uh my own time tracking tool manic time which I can only recommend to everybody out there um to do a deep deep analysis.
(05:33) So I want to actually see um how long did I wait for for uh the AI uh how much time did I spend prompting, how much time did I spend reviewing, how much time did I spend um bug fixing and everything. Um I also want to um actually really measure all costs uh related to the AI so tokens and flat rates and whatnot and I want to condense on a regular basis the lessons learned best practices and uh create some YouTube content from it.
(06:05) So this is the the project. My goal I have with this project is uh in the end my my major goal really is to have this functional open source opportunity opportunity management system for myself. So I want to create this for myself. I wanted to do this for quite some time now. Um but given the scope of the project, this is something which could be potentially commercialized.
(06:28) So um I will uh put this under an open-source uh I'm not exactly sure how they are called a fair fair use license where I um allow everybody to work on it increment and then use it for themselves even uh in a in a um commercial setting but not commercialized application themselves um for like two to three years or so and afterwards it's it's it's really open source.
(06:54) So this is will be the license. So maybe if this gets better than I even expect, even better than I expect, this will be a candidate to create a SAS application from because it's super helpful. And um then I want to have a datadriven driven productivity analysis um which can help me to further increase my my throughput down the down the line.
(07:19) So what I really want to see is um um how where where do I spend my time? How could I potentially increase my throughput by paralyzing parallelizing not paralyzing paralyzing something different uh by by doing parallel development and uh by taking me out of the loop by chunking things better. So um this analysis will give me uh huge insights to increase my workflow uh given the rising capabilities of AI tools which are coming down the line.
(07:50) Um also I like to teach people and uh and and teach uh what I learned and uh I also like to learn from from from from others. So um there will be many lessons learned and many tweaks uh for my workflow during this project and I really want to publish some of the best practices. And last not least, I want to sharpen my own public profile.
(08:13) So I'm doing this publicly here so that I can reference to it and uh basically prove that I'm actually uh kind of know what I do with these tools. So um a quick this is the only thing I prepared so far. So apart from some brainstorming I did already. Um this is um what I'm what I'm heading for. This is a little architecture diagram.
(08:36) Again, I deliberately overengineer this for my use case, but it might be uh a very great opportunity, a very great architecture. Let's see, here's the Rebbit MQ um down the line. So, um we will basically have uh two major components. We have the interactive component which is the UI where we can work on the projects with the canban boards and and all this and we will have an ingestion pipeline um where um crawlers or UI components spot potentially new new um uh opportunities uh process them and then pass them down to the to the uh interactive component.
(09:16) So uh this is the the main um the main architecture. The greenish things here are basically the components I will be working on. So we have a a UI, we have a crawler components, we have an ingestion pipeline which will be consisting of microservices. So this is not technically not a monolith. We can pro um um roll out multiple Docker containers and switch them up uh uh in production different settings.
(09:49) Uh I will create again my own event store uh system. So uh for persisting events this is the event sourcing pattern here. So we're getting in basically commands or uh I just call them UI events because command is a bit ambiguous with what I what I planned. So commands are coming in they are uh processed by command handlers or event handlers and um they basically do their their uh business logic evaluation uh storing this in the event source in event stores and um basically raising then um events to the again here on the bus to the domain events the domain
(10:24) events will be consumed by a kind of projector which puts them in an RDB and um this is wrong it's not command handler it's a query handler and uh UI can then query uh basically this one. So I will go to this into into more detail when I start the project. So we will have these four major building blocks and we will use uh Postgress and Rebin MQ for infrastructure and everything will be containerized.
(10:54) This is basically the the super broad overview. Then let's see where did I do this? Here I have some super super rough stretch uh scratches. uh um of of the UI. So um I imagine something like an an inbox where everything which was spotted and identified as a new opportunity uh comes in from upstream from the crawler and uh for for me to to basically uh evaluate and check off and um I can um basically um archive everything at every time and uh if I want to continue with this I send it to the backlog. Then we have this backloggy
(11:32) thing here uh where the main idea of backlog of the backlog is that I want to basically prioritize. So I want to drag and drop like in a classical um um scrum board for example scrum backlog. So I want to drag and drop them, edit them and uh basically also can archive them. So throw them away and um then start the um if if I really wanted to engage with a with a project with a customer.
(12:01) I can actually hit start. Then we get to the active section which is KBAN like and uh here we have the new things. We can drag and drop in this direction. We can uh re res resort them. And then I need to come up with some states. This is only idea. So uh basically I I I made first contact or try to make first contact with a with a um customer.
(12:24) Uh we had some presentation or some initial um contact with the agency or the customer. Uh we had a meeting, we sent a proposal, whatever. So um and in the end we can win or lose the project. And not part of this project so far is the actual handling. So I will not put in the CRM yet. So uh email handling and and contact management will not be within the scope of this four weeks.
(12:49) But I want to have this here uh this this this nice board. So this is the goal, right? And let me show you one thing because it's something I always love. This here is the super pristine folder basic folder X-ray project radar radar. um I just created like before I started recording the video. So like 10 minutes ago and um I know I don't know about you but for me this is a super attractive state of things because in my feeling software development is mainly an art form if you do it right.
(13:37) So this empty project folder here, I imagine must feel to me something like a marble block for a sculpture or a um uh um a blank sheet for an author uh or a canvas for for a painter or something. Um this is basically a blank sheet and now from my pure imagination I can create basically anything. So give me the time and resources and I can rebuild potentially any kind of software you can imagine big and small.
(14:16) I can rebuild SAP. Give me just enough decades to to do this and uh good AI support. Um and from here um this is a pure act of creation and it's always feeling super thrilling to me to start a project like this. This is this is a crazy um situation because I did so many projects during the last 40 years. So I started at the age of nine with bris programming that obviously um you get a feeling that uh you have a clear idea in your head and you know what you want to do and uh normally the start is easy.
(14:54) So you you you get make the first progress and uh then you get into into situations where you go take a wrong turn and you have to revert and and do things like this and sometimes you can just not pull it off within the constraints you set to yourself. So there is a real danger that this will lead to huge frustration like every project I ever started.
(15:19) On the other hand, if you can pull this off, then after a couple of hours or weeks or months, you have a complete new thing in the world created purely by your own imagination with a keyboard and a mouse. So there's nothing physical here. And um this is something which is out there which with its own inherent beauty in the in the in the the code itself and its usefulness hopefully uh in the application.
(15:50) And um I always find it fascinating to that that this is something um which is just uh flowing out of my imagination now into these tools and um combined with a little time and a keyboard. Um something will start to exist from this empty folder here. And uh yeah, this is why I'm excited to engage. And obviously um just as a side note um I I like to program a lot.
(16:21) I I like to to play a lot um or used to because I do not have the time. So I'm a old school World of Warcraft player and uh I have a couple of higher level characters built over the decades, but my main draw to World of Warcraft is actually restarting yet another character. So uh if you start a level one character in any game any massive multiplayer game which has been around around a long time then you have both this this the famili you the familiarity so you know exactly what will be happening and you know every quest and everything that's happening. I did
(17:02) everything a thousand times literally a thousand times and I must have built several hundred at least several hundred. I think we can go in the thousands um of level one characters which are sometimes I level them up to level 10 or sometimes I even throw them away level three and some go all the way up to whatever the cap is at the at the point and um this is something similar.
(17:25) So um starting and engaging is something fresh and you can um just put your own stamp on on everything and even though you have a clear idea and path of where this will be going um you cannot actually predict um where this will be ending. So um you're even with something you really understand deep down like me World of Warcraft I know every every uh corner in in uh in Wo um and I think I know quite a lot about project development and software development especially with the stack we were going for here um but
(18:07) still I cannot predict if this will be uh becoming a great experience or a really draw on my uh my my my my own self-esteem or whatever. So um this I just wanted to show you this is um uh windsoft by the way. So um we will not be working a lot of windsoft. We will be mainly working in uh cloud code and I will use windsoft as my as my uh um IDE when I work on the Linux side of things.
(18:42) uh WSL and um I will be using Ryder my my trusted Ryder IDE um on uh the checked out on the on the versions of uh the code which I checked out to to Windows but I will come to this later. So, and this is now just a super empty folder pristine um like the pristine canvas of a painter. And now after this rambling, I will start to paint.
(19:09) And hopefully you can get something out of it. I can get something out of it. And hopefully this will be a huge success. So stay tuned.
